The page actually loads successfully in browser (200 OK), but build process fails. Solution: Delete .next directory and restart dev server (rm -rf .next && npm run dev). The console.log statements added to page.tsx run on server (Server Component), so they appear in terminal logs, not browser console. No actual 500 error occurs - page renders fine, but build warnings appear in terminal."
